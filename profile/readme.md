**zeros**
==========

Hey, I'm Sam, the solo dev behind zeros. I'm building a custom os based on Arch Linux, just for kicks.

**What's zeros?**
----------------

zeros is my take on a Linux distro. I'm not making an ISO file, but instead, I'll provide some `.sh` files that you can run on top of an Arch Linux install to get the zer-os experience. It is basically just a customized Arch setup, with some tweaks and goodies thrown in.

**Features ( underwork )**
--------------------

* A Firefox setup that's just right
* Some other stuff which i think are cool

**Getting Started**
-------------------

Want to try zeros? Just grab the `.sh` files and run them on your Arch Linux install. Follow the prompts, and you'll be good to go.

**Contributing (not really)**
---------------------------

This is a solo project, so I'm not looking for contributors. But if you've got ideas or feedback, hit me up!

**License**
--------------

zeros is licensed under GPLv3. Don't worry about it.

**Contact (if you must)**

That's it! Have fun playing with zeros, and don't break anything. The zeros must not be broken.
